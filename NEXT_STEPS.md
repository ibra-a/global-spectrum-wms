# WMS Next Steps - While Waiting for Hardware

## âœ… What's Working Right Now

1. **Backend API** - Fully functional, connected to ERPNext
2. **PWA Interface** - All workflows built (Inbound, Outbound, Transfer, Scanner Test)
3. **ERPNext Integration** - Items, locations, stock entries all working
4. **Manual Testing** - You can test everything by typing barcodes manually

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Actions (While Waiting for Scanner)

### 1. **Test All Workflows with Manual Input** (30-60 min)

Even without a physical scanner, you can test the complete flow:

#### Test Inbound Receipt:
1. Open: `http://10.101.1.157:3000/inbound`
2. Type item code: `1000900` (or any item from your stock)
3. Type location: `Section 1 - A1 - GSS`
4. Enter quantity: `10`
5. Create draft â†’ Go to ERPNext â†’ Submit

#### Test Outbound Issue:
1. Open: `http://10.101.1.157:3000/outbound`
2. Type item code with existing stock
3. Type location where stock exists
4. Enter quantity
5. Verify stock validation works

#### Test Transfer:
1. Open: `http://10.101.1.157:3000/transfer`
2. Type source location
3. Type item code
4. Type destination location
5. Enter quantity
6. Create transfer

**Goal:** Verify all workflows create drafts correctly in ERPNext.

---

### 2. **Print Barcode Labels for Testing** (1-2 hours)

You mentioned you have a Zebra printer. Let's create labels for your most common items:

**What to Print:**
- Location labels for each shelf (Section 1 - A1, Section 1 - A2, etc.)
- Item labels for top 20-30 items
- Use the GSS-RM-XXXXXX format

**Why:** Once you have printed labels, you can test manually until the scanner arrives.

---

### 3. **Complete Section 4 Setup** (1-2 hours)

You mentioned Section 4 isn't printed yet. Let's complete the warehouse setup:

**Action Items:**
1. Review the Section 4 layout in your CSV
2. Import Section 4 locations into ERPNext (like you did for Sections 1-5)
3. Print Section 4 location labels
4. Physically label Section 4 shelves

---

### 4. **Verify Data in ERPNext** (30-45 min)

Make sure your ERPNext is properly configured:

#### Check Items:
- All items have `custom_barcode` field filled
- All items have `custom_stock_location` set (default location)
- Stock UOM is correct (PCs, etc.)

#### Check Warehouses:
- All locations imported correctly
- Hierarchy is correct (Sections â†’ Racks â†’ Bins)
- No missing locations

#### Check Stock Entries:
- Review any drafts you created from PWA testing
- Submit the valid ones
- Delete any test entries

---

### 5. **Document Your Workflows** (30 min)

Create simple guides for your team:

**Create these documents:**
1. **Inbound SOP** - How to receive items into warehouse
2. **Outbound SOP** - How to issue items for production
3. **Transfer SOP** - How to move items between locations
4. **Error Handling** - What to do if item not found, location wrong, etc.

---

### 6. **Plan Your Pilot Rollout** (30-45 min)

Based on your PRD, plan the pilot phase:

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Which section will you pilot first? (Section 1, 2, 3, or 5?)
2. Which items will be in the pilot? (10-20 items?)
3. Who will test it? (1-2 warehouse staff?)
4. How long will the pilot run? (1-2 weeks?)
5. What success metrics? (Accuracy, speed, errors?)

---

### 7. **Prepare Training Materials** (1 hour)

While waiting for hardware, create training materials:

**Create:**
1. Quick reference cards (printed, laminated)
2. Screenshots of each workflow step
3. Common error messages and solutions
4. Video walkthrough (record iPhone screen)

---

### 8. **ERPNext Customization Review** (30 min)

Double-check your custom fields are set up correctly:

**Verify in ERPNext UI:**
1. Go to "Customize Form" for Item
   - Check `custom_barcode` exists
   - Check `custom_stock_location` exists
2. Go to "Customize Form" for Stock Entry
   - Check if you need `idempotency_key` for offline sync (future)

---

### 9. **Review Stock Balance Data** (30-45 min)

You have the stock balance CSV open. Let's use it:

**Actions:**
1. Identify items with highest turnover
2. These should be your pilot items
3. Verify their locations in ERPNext match reality
4. Update any discrepancies

**Key Items to Check:**
- Cotton Piping Rope items (1000001, 1000002, etc.)
- High-quantity items
- Frequently moved items

---

### 10. **Backend Improvements** (Optional - 1-2 hours)

If you want to improve the backend while waiting:

**Enhancements:**
1. Add stock balance endpoint (show available qty in PWA)
2. Add auto-submit for Stock Entries (remove manual step)
3. Add transaction history endpoint
4. Add search by item name (not just code)

---

## ðŸ¤” Questions to Think About

While waiting for the scanner, consider:

1. **What's your biggest pain point right now with inventory?**
   - Wrong items picked?
   - Items in wrong locations?
   - Slow picking process?
   - Stockouts not noticed?

2. **How will you measure success?**
   - Picking accuracy % ?
   - Time per transaction?
   - Inventory accuracy?
   - Stockout reduction?

3. **What's your rollout timeline?**
   - Pilot start date?
   - Full rollout date?
   - Training schedule?

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Bottom Line

**You can make significant progress without the scanner!**

The scanner is just an input device - everything else is ready. Use manual input to:
- Test the workflows
- Train yourself
- Identify issues
- Prepare documentation
- Plan the rollout

When the scanner arrives, you'll be 100% ready to go live immediately!
