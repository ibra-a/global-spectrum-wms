## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Backend (FastAPI):**
```python
- Simple in-memory cache with TTL
- Cached endpoints: /api/locations, /api/items/search
- Live endpoints: /api/stock-balance, /api/stock-entry
- Cache management: /api/cache/clear
- Performance: 4-6ms response time (cached)
```

### **Frontend (Next.js PWA):**
```typescript
- Mobile-first responsive design
- LocationPicker with always-visible scanner
- Suggested location feature
- Real-time stock display
- Recent locations memory
```

### **Cache Strategy:**
```
Locations: 10 min TTL (warehouses rarely change)
Items: 5 min TTL (products update occasionally)
Stock: NO CACHE (always accurate)
Transactions: NO CACHE (immediate DRAFT)
```

## 🎯 VERIFIED WORKING

**Test Transaction (From Logs):**
```
Item: 1000101
Quantity: 2.0
Destination: Section 1 - A1 - GSS
DRAFT: WMS-STE-2025-00012
Status: ✅ Successfully created in ERPNext
```

**Cache Performance (From Logs):**
```
Cache Hits: 6+ in test session
Cache Misses: 2 (initial loads only)
Hit Rate: 75%+
Result: Instant responses for users
```

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Acceptable)

1. **First User of the Day:** ~876ms initial load (then cached)
2. **Stock Balance:** ~754ms (could be cached but kept live for accuracy)
3. **Manual SUBMIT Required:** DRAFTs must be submitted in ERPNext manually
4. **No Offline Mode:** Requires internet connection
5. **No Authentication:** Open access on local network

**Status: All acceptable for current use case** ✅
