## Key Findings

### Current ERPNext Structure
```
All Warehouses - GSS (Parent)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Raw Materials - GSS (393 items, no location tracking)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Finished Goods - GSS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Work In Progress - GSS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Stores - GSS
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Goods In Transit - GSS
```

### Target Structure (After Import)
```
Raw Materials - GSS (Parent)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section 1 - GSS (96 locations) ‚úÖ Labels printed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section 2 - GSS (18 locations) ‚úÖ Labels printed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section 3 - GSS (30 locations) ‚úÖ Labels printed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section 4 - GSS (28 locations) ‚ùå Labels NOT printed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section 5 - GSS (10 locations) ‚úÖ Labels printed
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Central Rack - GSS (15 locations) ‚úÖ Labels printed
```

### Barcode Strategy
- **Location barcodes:** Use warehouse names (e.g., "Section 1 - A1 - GSS")
- **Item barcodes:** Use item_code (e.g., 1000001, 1000002)
- **Format:** Code128, 4"√ó2" labels, Zebra ZD220t printer
- **Compact codes:** S1-A1, S2-R1-A1, CR-A1 (for human reference)

## Recommended Immediate Actions for PO

### Priority 1: Document Sharding üìÑ
```bash
*shard-doc prd docs/prd
*shard-doc architecture docs/architecture
```

**Why:** Break large documents into manageable sections for development

**Expected Output:**
- `docs/prd/` with sharded PRD sections
- `docs/architecture/` with sharded architecture sections

### Priority 2: Create Epics üì¶

**Recommended Epics:**

1. **Epic: Warehouse Location Setup**
   - Import pilot warehouses to ERPNext
   - Verify structure and hierarchy
   - Print Section 4 labels (future)

2. **Epic: Scanning PWA - Core Workflows**
   - Authentication with ERPNext
   - Location scanning (barcode input)
   - Item scanning (item_code input)
   - Quantity entry

3. **Epic: Inbound Receipt Workflow**
   - Scan PO to load expected items
   - Scan item + location + qty
   - Create Stock Entry (Material Receipt)
   - Offline queue with idempotency

4. **Epic: Outbound Pick Workflow**
   - Load Pick List from ERPNext
   - Guided picking (scan location ‚Üí item ‚Üí qty)
   - Create Stock Entry (Material Issue)
   - Pick confirmation

5. **Epic: Transfer Workflow**
   - Scan source location
   - Scan item + qty
   - Scan destination location
   - Create Stock Entry (Material Transfer)

6. **Epic: Offline Sync & Idempotency**
   - IndexedDB queue
   - Background sync with retry
   - Idempotency key generation
   - Conflict resolution

7. **Epic: Print Service Integration** (Optional Phase 2)
   - ZPL template management
   - Label print endpoints
   - Zebra printer communication
   - Print job status tracking

### Priority 3: Validate & Refine

**Run PO Checklist:**
```bash
*execute-checklist-po
```

**Validate:**
- PRD completeness
- Architecture consistency
- Requirements traceability
- Acceptance criteria clarity

## Critical Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Import Timing
**When should warehouse locations be imported to ERPNext?**

- **Option A:** Import pilot now (169 locations), Section 4 later
- **Option B:** Import all now (197 locations), labels for S4 come later
- **Recommendation:** Option A (matches physical reality)

### Decision 2: Development Approach
**Build order for epics?**

- **Option A:** PWA first (scanning workflows), then print service
- **Option B:** Print service first (complete labels), then PWA
- **Recommendation:** Option A (can test with existing labels)

### Decision 3: Pilot Scope
**Start small or medium?**

- **Option A:** Mini-pilot (Central Rack only - 15 locations)
- **Option B:** Phase 1A (Central Rack + Section 5 - 25 locations)
- **Option C:** Full pilot (CR + S1 + S5 - 121 locations)
- **Recommendation:** Option B (balanced risk/reward)

## Open Questions for PO

1. **User Stories Format:** 
   - Standard BMAD story template?
   - Include acceptance criteria in stories?
   - Reference architecture sections?

2. **Story Sizing:**
   - How granular should stories be?
   - Group by feature or by workflow?
   - Include infrastructure stories (Docker, deployment)?

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Which epics block others?
   - Can some epics run in parallel?
   - What's the critical path?

4. **Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - Separate epic for offline sync?
   - Performance testing approach?
   - Security/authentication priority?

---

## Resources Available

### Documentation
- All docs in `docs/` folder
- Architecture diagrams needed (consider adding)
- API contracts documented in architecture.md

### Data & Scripts
- ERPNext API working with credentials in `.env`
- Test scripts validate connectivity
- CSV generators for warehouse import

### BMAD Tools
- BMAD-METHOD installed in project
- Core agents available (PO, Architect, SM, Dev, QA)
- Templates and checklists ready

---

## Success Criteria for PO Phase

**Completed when:**
- [ ] PRD and Architecture sharded into sections
- [ ] Epics created with clear scope and acceptance criteria
- [ ] User stories drafted for first epic (Warehouse Setup)
- [ ] Dependencies mapped between epics
- [ ] Prioritization complete (what to build first)
- [ ] Ready to hand off to Scrum Master for story refinement

---

## Risks & Concerns

### Risk 1: Scope Creep
**Concern:** Feature requests may expand beyond MVP  
**Mitigation:** PO should enforce Phase 1 scope (pilot only)

### Risk 2: Technical Complexity
**Concern:** Offline sync with idempotency is complex  
**Mitigation:** Consider simplifying to online-only for pilot

### Risk 3: User Adoption
**Concern:** Warehouse staff resistance to change  
**Mitigation:** Start with Central Rack (high-value, visible wins)

### Risk 4: ERPNext API Limitations
**Concern:** API may not support all needed operations  
**Mitigation:** Architect can advise on ERPNext server scripts

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Activate Product Owner Agent**
   ```
   *po
   ```

2. **Review Documents**
   - Read PRD thoroughly
   - Read Architecture thoroughly
   - Validate completeness

3. **Shard Documents**
   ```
   *shard-doc prd docs/prd
   *shard-doc architecture docs/architecture
   ```

4. **Create First Epic**
   ```
   *create-epic
   ```
   Start with "Warehouse Location Setup" (simplest, foundational)

5. **Plan Development Sequence**
   - Prioritize epics
   - Identify dependencies
   - Define acceptance criteria

6. **Prepare for SM Handoff**
   - Epics ready for story creation
   - Clear requirements and constraints
   - Acceptance criteria defined

## Final Notes

This is a **brownfield project** - we're enhancing an existing ERPNext system with location tracking and barcode scanning. The system is live with 393+ items already being managed. Any changes must:

1. ‚úÖ **Preserve existing data** - Don't break current workflows
2. ‚úÖ **Allow gradual migration** - Support dual system during transition
3. ‚úÖ **Maintain ERPNext as single source of truth** - No parallel databases
4. ‚úÖ **Support offline operations** - Warehouse WiFi may be spotty

**Good luck, Sarah! The analysis phase is complete. Time to plan the build.** üéØ
