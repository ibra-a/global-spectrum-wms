### Step 4: Map Columns

ERPNext will attempt to auto-map columns. Verify the mapping:

|------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| name | Name | ‚úÖ Yes | Unique warehouse identifier |
| warehouse_name | Warehouse Name | ‚úÖ Yes | Display name |
| parent_warehouse | Parent Warehouse | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional | Must exist if specified |
| is_group | Is Group | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional | 1 = group, 0 = storage location |
| company | Company | ‚úÖ Yes | Must match your company name |
| disabled | Disabled | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional | 0 = active, 1 = disabled |

**Important:** If your company name is NOT "Global Spectrum":
- You'll need to edit the CSV first
- Find/Replace "Global Spectrum" with your actual company name
- Or manually map during import

### Step 5: Import Settings

2. Click **Start Import** button
3. ERPNext will begin processing the 207 records
4. Progress bar will show import status

**Expected time:** 2-3 minutes for 207 records

### Step 7: Monitor Import

- ‚úÖ **Green checkmarks** = Successful imports
- ‚ùå **Red X marks** = Errors (see error messages)
- üìä **Progress percentage**

**Common Errors and Fixes:**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "Parent Warehouse not found" | Missing parent | Create "Raw Materials - GSS" first |
| "Duplicate entry" | Warehouse already exists | Skip or update existing |
| "Company not found" | Wrong company name | Edit CSV with correct company |
| "Permission denied" | Insufficient rights | Contact admin for Stock Manager role |

### Step 8: Verify Import

After import completes:

1. Go back to **Stock ‚Üí Warehouse** list
2. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ Section 1 - GSS (group)
   - ‚úÖ Section 2 - GSS (group)
   - ‚úÖ Section 3 - GSS (group)
   - ‚úÖ Section 5 - GSS (group)
   - ‚úÖ Central Rack - GSS (group)

3. Click on **Section 1 - GSS** to expand
4. Verify child locations exist:
   - Section 1 - A1 - GSS
   - Section 1 - A2 - GSS
   - ... (96 total locations)

5. Repeat for other sections

### Step 9: Quick Test

**Test that locations are usable:**

1. Go to **Stock ‚Üí Stock Entry ‚Üí New**
2. Select **Material Transfer** as purpose
3. In the items table, try to select a location:
   - Source Warehouse: Type "Section 1" ‚Üí Should show dropdown with all S1 locations
   - Target Warehouse: Type "Central Rack" ‚Üí Should show CR locations
4. **Don't submit** - this is just a test
5. If you see the locations in dropdowns = ‚úÖ Success!

## Rollback Instructions

**If import fails or you need to undo:**

### Option A: Delete Individual Warehouses (Safe)

1. Go to **Stock ‚Üí Warehouse**
2. Find imported warehouses (e.g., "Section 1 - GSS")
3. Click warehouse name to open
4. Click **Delete** button
5. Repeat for all imported warehouses

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** You can only delete warehouses with no stock transactions

### Option B: Bulk Delete via Script (Advanced)

If many warehouses need deletion, use the ERPNext console:

1. Go to **Developer ‚Üí Console**
2. Run this script:

```python
# Delete pilot warehouses
import frappe

warehouses_to_delete = [
    "Section 1 - GSS", "Section 2 - GSS", "Section 3 - GSS",
    "Section 5 - GSS", "Central Rack - GSS"
]

for wh_name in warehouses_to_delete:
    try:
        # Delete child warehouses first
        children = frappe.get_all("Warehouse", filters={"parent_warehouse": wh_name})
        for child in children:
            frappe.delete_doc("Warehouse", child.name, force=1)
        
        # Delete parent
        frappe.delete_doc("Warehouse", wh_name, force=1)
        print(f"‚úÖ Deleted {wh_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error deleting {wh_name}: {e}")

frappe.db.commit()
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use with caution!** This force-deletes warehouses.
