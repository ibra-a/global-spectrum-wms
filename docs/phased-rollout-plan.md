# Phased Rollout Plan - Raw Materials WMS

## Current Status: Labels Already Printed

‚úÖ **Section 1** - 96 labels printed  
‚úÖ **Section 2** - 18 labels printed  
‚úÖ **Section 3** - 30 labels printed  
‚úÖ **Section 5** - 10 labels printed  
‚úÖ **Central Rack** - 15 labels printed  
‚ùå **Section 4** - 28 labels NOT printed yet (hold for Phase 2)

**Total Ready for Pilot:** 169 locations  
**Total Pending:** 28 locations (Section 4)

---

## Recommended Pilot Approach

### **Phase 1A: Pilot Test (Week 1)**
**Goal:** Validate scanning workflow, label quality, user training

**Scope:**
- ‚úÖ **Central Rack** (15 locations) - HIGH traffic area
- ‚úÖ **Section 5** (10 locations) - SMALL area for quick wins

**Total Phase 1A:** 25 locations

**Why this order:**
1. **Central Rack** = Most important, high-frequency picks
2. **Section 5** = Smallest section, easy to complete quickly
3. Quick validation before rolling out larger sections

---

### **Phase 1B: Expand Pilot (Week 2)**
**Goal:** Scale to larger sections, validate bulk operations

**Scope:**
- ‚úÖ **Section 1** (96 locations) - LARGEST section
- ‚úÖ **Section 2** (18 locations) - Medium complexity with racks
- ‚úÖ **Section 3** (30 locations) - Complex 4-rack structure

**Total Phase 1B:** 144 additional locations

**Why this order:**
1. Section 1 is largest - validates scalability
2. Sections 2-3 test rack-based naming (S2-R1-A1, S3-R4-B1)

---

### **Phase 2: Complete Rollout (Week 3-4)**
**Goal:** Print and deploy Section 4 after validation

**Scope:**
- ‚ùå **Section 4** (28 locations) - Print labels after Phase 1 success

**Actions:**
1. Review Phase 1 results
2. Adjust label template if needed
3. Print Section 4 labels
4. Import Section 4 warehouses
5. Deploy and train

---

## Immediate Action Plan

### **Step 1: Import Pilot Warehouses ONLY** (Do Now!)

I'll create a **reduced CSV** with only the sections that have labels printed:

**Import Order:**
1. Central Rack (15 locations)
2. Section 5 (10 locations)
3. Section 1 (96 locations)
4. Section 2 (18 locations)
5. Section 3 (30 locations)

**Total:** 169 locations ready to use immediately

---

### **Step 2: Test Workflow** (Week 1)

**Central Rack Test:**
1. Scan location barcode `CR-A1`
2. Scan item code `1000001`
3. Enter quantity
4. Create Stock Entry in ERPNext
5. Verify location appears in bin

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Barcode scans correctly
- ‚úÖ Location created in ERPNext
- ‚úÖ Stock Entry records location
- ‚úÖ User completes flow in <2 minutes

---

### **Step 3: Section 4 Completion** (After Pilot Success)

**If pilot succeeds:**
1. Generate Section 4 ZPL templates
2. Print 28 labels (Section 4 - A1 through G4)
3. Import Section 4 warehouses to ERPNext
4. Deploy labels to warehouse
5. Train staff on Section 4

**If adjustments needed:**
1. Fix label template issues
2. Reprint pilot sections if necessary
3. Then proceed to Section 4

---

## Modified ERPNext Import Strategy

### Option A: Import All Now (Recommended)
- Import all 197 locations including Section 4
- Labels for Section 4 come later
- **Advantage:** Structure complete, just need physical labels

### Option B: Phased Import (Conservative)
- Import only 169 locations (without Section 4)
- Import Section 4 later when labels ready
- **Advantage:** ERPNext matches physical reality

**My Recommendation:** **Option A** - Import all now, it's just data. Print Section 4 labels when ready.

## Testing Checklist

### Phase 1A Testing (Central Rack + Section 5)

**Day 1-2: Central Rack (15 locations)**
- [ ] Verify all 15 labels are on physical racks
- [ ] Import warehouses to ERPNext
- [ ] Test 5 inbound receipts (scan location ‚Üí item ‚Üí qty)
- [ ] Test 5 picks (guided by pick list)
- [ ] Test 2 location transfers
- [ ] Gather user feedback

**Day 3-4: Section 5 (10 locations)**
- [ ] Verify all 10 labels are on shelves
- [ ] Test 5 inbound receipts
- [ ] Test 5 picks
- [ ] Compare speed vs non-barcoded workflow

**Day 5: Review & Adjust**
- [ ] Review error rates
- [ ] Adjust PWA UX if needed
- [ ] Prepare training materials for Phase 1B

---

### Phase 1B Testing (Sections 1-3)

**Week 2:**
- [ ] Deploy Section 1 (96 locations)
- [ ] Deploy Section 2 (18 locations)
- [ ] Deploy Section 3 (30 locations)
- [ ] Measure KPIs: scan errors, time savings, accuracy

---

### Phase 2: Section 4 (After Success)

**Week 3-4:**
- [ ] Generate ZPL templates for Section 4
- [ ] Print 28 labels
- [ ] Physical label deployment
- [ ] Import Section 4 to ERPNext (if not done earlier)
- [ ] Staff training
- [ ] Go-live

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Labels Don't Scan Well
**Mitigation:**
- Test scan quality before mass deployment
- Have backup printer/consumables
- Keep manual entry option during transition

### Risk 2: User Resistance
**Mitigation:**
- Start with Central Rack (high visibility, high value)
- Quick wins in Section 5
- Champions from pilot group help train others

### Risk 3: ERPNext Performance Issues
**Mitigation:**
- Start small (25 locations)
- Monitor API response times
- Optimize queries if needed

---

## Success Metrics (Pilot Phase)

**Target for Phase 1A (Central Rack + Section 5):**
- Scan success rate: >95%
- Average scan-to-confirmation: <2 seconds
- User satisfaction: 4/5 or higher
- Error rate: <1%
- Training time: <30 minutes per user

**If metrics met:** Proceed to Phase 1B  
**If not met:** Adjust and retest

---

## Next Steps (Right Now)

**Choose your import strategy:**

1. **"Import all now"** - Import full 197 locations, print Section 4 later
2. **"Import pilot only"** - Import 169 locations (CR, S1, S2, S3, S5)
3. **"Start smallest"** - Import only CR + S5 (25 locations) to test first
